## Design & Planning:

### User Stories

1. As a beginner, I want to be able to see the game rules to understand the game.
2. As a player, I want the game to prevent invalid moves (like dividing by zero or using negative/decimal results), so I play within the game’s rules.
3. As a player, I want to be able to deselect a number or operator, so that I can change my mind before committing to a move.
4. As a player, I want the interface to highlight which numbers and operators I’ve selected so I don’t get confused during my turn.
5. As a player, I want to see my score increase when I win so that I can track my progress.
6. As a player, I want to undo a move, so that I can try a different calculation if I make a mistake.
7. As an experienced player, I want the game to be timed to make the game more competitive and rewarding.
8. As a player, I want to be presented with my score at the end of the game so that I can attempt to beat it next time.
9. As a player, I want the option to quit the game and start again, so that I can reset my progress and begin a new game at any time.

### Wireframes

The wireframes for this website were created using Balsamiq to establish a clear and intuitive structure. I followed the mobile-first approach ensuring my site is optimised and responsive across all devices.

The site was created using the Visual Studio code editor and pushed to github to the remote repository ‘S-and-S-care-mp1’.

The following git commands were used throughout development to push code to the remote repo:

```git add .``` - This command was used to add the file(s) to the staging area before they are committed.

```git commit -m “commit message”``` - This command was used to commit changes to the local repository queue ready for the final step.

```git push``` - This command was used to push all committed code to the remote repository on github.
